## Installation

You can download BookChat from [release](https://github.com/matheusfaustino/bookchat/releases) page. It's cross-platform(Linux, MacOS, Windows).

### Why?

Because I don't like to use webapps in my browser.
So, if you think like me and would like to chat with your friends, this is your chance!

### Push notification

To enable push notification you must go in gear icon (top left) > settings > allow push

### TODO

- Make this app installable using npm
- I'm thinking...

### Disclaimer

This is NOT a official facebook app.
